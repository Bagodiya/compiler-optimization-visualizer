"""The Annotation type — one optimization we spotted in a block of assembly.

Everything in the annotation engine ends up as one of these. A detector reads
the asm for a function, decides that (say) the stack frame is gone, and hands
back an Annotation naming that along with the lines it applies to. The
renderer later prints them next to those lines.

This module is only the shape they all share; the detectors themselves come
after it.

      are counted the same way `render.line_number_gutter` counts, so a
